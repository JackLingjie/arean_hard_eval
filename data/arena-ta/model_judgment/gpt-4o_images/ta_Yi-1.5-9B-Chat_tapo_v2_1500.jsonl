Visit www.DeepL.com/pro for more information.\nHow are our historic stone houses built and what problems do stone structures face today?\nI have been trying to read up on natural stone masonry, and in particular trying to find examples of constructions where both natural stone and brick have been used in the same construction. The overwhelming majority of our historic buildings are in stone, and not infrequently they have, if not entire walls of natural stone, then at least elements of natural stone.\nThe focus of this compilation has been to read about a wide range of topics in the field of natural stone masonry, but perhaps the most focus has been on craft processes and descriptions of approaches to the material.\nWhich stone is used where varies greatly from place to place, so the magnifying glass has also ended up reading about the difference in materials across the country, as well as the problems we face in the conservation and restoration of natural stone structures today.\nNatural stone is a material that has historically been used in Sweden since before the advent of bricks. Our early stone buildings were built by cold masonry where stones were stacked on top of each other without the use of mortar or other binders.\nHowever, natural stone has had difficulty asserting itself in buildings outside of high-rise buildings such as churches, manor houses and mansions, partly because of the ingrained tradition of building residential buildings in wood, but also because it was an expensive material, both in terms of transportation if the material was not close at hand, but also in terms of processing.\nIn 1766, at a time when there was a shortage of wood for building houses, and even a promise of a 20-year tax exemption if you built your house in stone, Carl Wijnblad writes about how natural stone was difficult to handle and unsuitable for building houses. Here, however, he is talking about natural stone in the form of gray stone, a collective term for blocks of stone picked directly from the ground or dug up, for example, during agricultural work, and not about the brick, which he warmly advocated in his book Beskrifning, huru allmogens buildings, so of stone, as well as trees, must be erected with the greatest economy, according to attached project drawings in six copper pieces, as well as proposals for necessary building materials. He found the stone unsuitable as it requires a lot of processing and a lot of lime to be good enough to be used other than for foundation walls and cellars. The stone was also considered to be damp and cold, and suitable only for animal houses.\nBuildings made of both natural stone, in the form of grey stone, and brick in the same construction are described in a number of different designs in the training material from Hermods in the document Byggnadskonstruktionslära (för murare) : undervisning per korrespondens (1907). In the chapter Walls of stone blocks: \"Such walls of stone blocks, which are to have any appreciable height, are, however, erected as mixed walls, i.e. they are erected with horizontal bands and vertical columns of brick\". This also clarifies several other\napproaches to the inclusion of bricks in natural stone walls, with bricks or more tumbled stones being used in virtually all parts of the wall where greater precision is required. Window surrounds, the corners of the wall, the above-mentioned stabilizing shifts, and even roof ends should be made of brick. Hermod's text is relatively exhaustive in the field of natural stone masonry, and describes various approaches to stones in differently worked conditions, but no information about who or where these experiences and approaches come from is given in the text. The text is familiarly signed by Hermods himself, but it is doubtful that he is the author.\nFurther reading in, for example, Arvid Henström's book Landtbyggnadskonsten volume 5 (1869) offers a slightly more detailed account of the building method, but in general the advice sounds the same as in Hermod's text. As an engineer, Henström should be well versed in the art of building, and his recommendations are sound, even if the text itself is not significantly exhaustive in terms of illustrations or other aids other than a running text description of different approaches to masonry with natural stone.\nThe fact that someone like Henström is giving the same advice as Hermods gives good credit to the fact that the information in the training material is sound and well based on literature in the field.\nHowever, Henström makes it clear already in the introduction to this text that it is not written for the experienced craftsman, but \"it is intended for the farmer and his inexperienced workers who are unfamiliar with building details and their form and execution\", which explains the lack of drawing examples and more detailed descriptions of the craft processes. Both texts recommend the use of the best quality hydraulic lime mortar for masonry.\nOne conclusion to be drawn from reading both Hermod's and Henström's texts is that the construction of a stone wall does not differ so dramatically, whether it is built of brick or natural stone. The goal is to achieve a joint where the different building blocks interact with each other to create a stable structure that can withstand forces from different directions, but different solutions need to be applied depending on how processed the stones are. Both provide insight into the role that brick can play in natural stone construction, and are described as the rational choice in many cases. Neither text is exhaustive, or should be seen as detailed descriptions of craft processes, but they can be used, with a little prior knowledge, as a complement to the execution of masonry with natural stone.\nStructures using relatively unprocessed natural stone face a number of problems in addition to those encountered during construction.\nThe Geological Society London publishes a journal that compiles information and articles in the field. The journal itself is locked behind fees, but the introduction was available for guidance to other authors in the field. The introduction is written by Professor of Geology Siegesmund Siegfried, who in his text highlights the problems faced in the preservation and restoration of natural stone buildings. Strategies on how to deal with damage caused by natural degradation of the stone, how the environment influences the grading, how anthropogenic circumstances accelerate decay, attack by algae or microorganisms in the stone.\nThe reading of Siegesmund's text therefore led me on a trail of other texts in the field, and eventually to the article Impact of the surface roughness of stones used in historical buildings on biodeterioration, a text on how the surface texture porosity of building stones influences the speed and degree of biological impact and degradation.\n\nBiological impact refers to plants, both clinging plants with roots and creeping plants such as lichens and mosses, and their impact on the structure of the stone, both as living and dead material. The material is based on investigations carried out in Nigde, Turkey, which is somewhat different from conditions in Sweden, but the different types of rocks investigated are similar to those used in Sweden, such as large amounts of limestone. The source is really only tangentially relevant to this compilation, but interesting reading nonetheless, and definitely a recurring topic in the question of how our stone houses should be taken care of.\nSources\n● Henström, Arvid (1869) Practical handbook in the art of rural construction: including the study of building materials, the processing and joining of building materials, the shape, dimensions and strength of building components ....

Strategies on how to deal with damage caused by natural degradation of the stone, how the environment influences the grading, how anthropogenic circumstances accelerate decay, attack by algae or microorganisms in the stone.\nThe reading of Siegesmund's text therefore led me on a trail of other texts in the field, and eventually to the article Impact of the surface roughness of stones used in historical buildings on biodeterioration, a text on how the surface texture porosity of building stones influences the speed and degree of biological impact and degradation.\n\nBiological impact refers to plants, both clinging plants with roots and creeping plants such as lichens and mosses, and their impact on the structure of the stone, both as living and dead material. The material is based on investigations carried out in Nigde, Turkey, which is somewhat different from conditions in Sweden, but the different types of rocks investigated are similar to those used in Sweden, such as large amounts of limestone. The source is really only tangentially relevant to this compilation, but interesting reading nonetheless, and definitely a recurring topic in the question of how our stone houses should be taken care of.\nSources\n● Henström, Arvid (1869) Practical handbook in the art of rural construction: including the study of building materials, the processing and joining of building materials, the shape, dimensions and strength of building components ....

As we all know, for my email to work reliably and not get blocked I need to have an unchanging public IP address. Due to my circumstances I am not able to get a static IP address through my ISP or change ISPs at the moment.\n\nThe solution I have found is to buy a 4G SIM card with a static IP (from an ISP that offers that), which I can then use with a USB dongle. However this 4G connection costs me substantially per MB to use.\n\nBut. Mail is the only server that needs a static IP address. For everything else using my home network connection and updating my DNS records with DDNS would be fine. I have tested this setup previously for other services and it has worked.\n\nSo. I was wondering. Would it in theory be possible to: connect the server to two network interfaces at the same time and route traffic depending on destination port. I.e. all outgoing connections to ports 25, 465, 587, and possibly 993 should be sent through the 4G dongle interface (enx344b50000000) and all other connections sent over eth0. Similarly, the server should listen for incoming connections on the same ports on enx344b50000000 and listen on all other ports (if allowed by ufw) on eth0.\n\nI would then need DNS records from mail.mydomain.tld —> <4g static public IP> and mydomain.tld —> <home public IP> (updated with DDNS, and NAT configured on my home router).\n\nComputers on the internet would then be able to seamlessly connect to these two IP addresses, not “realising” that they are in fact the same machine, as long as requests to mail.mydomain.tld are always on the above mentioned ports.\n\nQuestion: Is this possible? Could it be a robust solution that works the way I hope? Would someone be able to help me set it up?\n\nI have come across a few different guides in my DuckDuckGo-ing, I understand it has to do with setting a mark in iptables and assigning them to a table using ip route. However I haven't managed to get it to work yet, and many of these guides are for VPNs and they all seem to be slightly different to each other.

As we all know, for my email to work reliably and not get blocked I need to have an unchanging public IP address. Due to my circumstances I am not able to get a static IP address through my ISP or change ISPs at the moment.\n\nThe solution I have found is to buy a 4G SIM card with a static IP (from an ISP that offers that), which I can then use with a USB dongle. However this 4G connection costs me substantially per MB to use.\n\nBut. Mail is the only server that needs a static IP address. For everything else using my home network connection and updating my DNS records with DDNS would be fine. I have tested this setup previously for other services and it has worked.\n\nSo. I was wondering. Would it in theory be possible to: connect the server to two network interfaces at the same time and route traffic depending on destination port. I.e. all outgoing connections to ports 25, 465, 587, and possibly 993 should be sent through the 4G dongle interface (enx344b50000000) and all other connections sent over eth0. Similarly, the server should listen for incoming connections on the same ports on enx344b50000000 and listen on all other ports (if allowed by ufw) on eth0.\n\nI would then need DNS records from mail.mydomain.tld —> <4g static public IP> and mydomain.tld —> <home public IP> (updated with DDNS, and NAT configured on my home router).\n\nComputers on the internet would then be able to seamlessly connect to these two IP addresses, not “realising” that they are in fact the same machine, as long as requests to mail.mydomain.tld are always on the above mentioned ports.\n\nQuestion: Is this possible? Could it be a robust solution that works the way I hope? Would someone be able to help me set it up?\n\nI have come across a few different guides in my DuckDuckGo-ing, I understand it has to do with setting a mark in iptables and assigning them to a table using ip route. However I haven't managed to get it to work yet, and many of these guides are for VPNs and they all seem to be slightly different to each other.

There is appropriate spacing between paragraphs, enhancing readability.\n\n2. **Analysis of Assistant B's response**:\n    - **Readability**: The text is also clear and easy to read. However, some sentences are longer and more complex, which might make it slightly harder to follow.\n    - **Visual Organization**: The response lacks clear headings and subheadings, which makes it less visually organized compared to Assistant A's response. The information is presented in a single continuous block of text.\n    - **Consistency**: The style and format are consistent, but the lack of headings affects the overall consistency in terms of visual organization.\n    - **Overall Structure**: The paragraphs are well-structured and logically connected, but the absence of clear sections makes it harder to navigate through the information.\n\n3. **Comparison**:\n    - Both responses are similar in readability, but Assistant A's response is slightly easier to follow due to shorter sentences.\n    - Assistant A has better visual organization with clear headings and subheadings, making it easier to navigate.\n    - Both responses maintain consistency in style and format, but Assistant A's use of headings enhances this aspect.\n    - Overall, Assistant A's response stands out in terms of readability, visual organization, and overall structure.\n\nMy final verdict is Assistant A is significantly better: [[A>>B]].", "score": "A>>B"}]}
